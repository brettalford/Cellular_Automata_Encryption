The plan is to take the cellular automata program i designed before and adapt it to encrypt and decrypt data which i will do by creating 
a key based on the progression and placemet of initial random pixels, with the program being run in either reverse or forward with the 
result being used for decryption purposes.

the key is an input pssword, grid size, and number of steps while the resulting keystring of that formation is xor with the bits in a file to encrypt it.
